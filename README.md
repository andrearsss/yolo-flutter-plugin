## Scope

This project is a fork of the original YOLO Flutter plugin, extended to deliver real-time feedback on exercise form by analyzing keypoints generated by a custom pose estimation model.

The extension involves adaptation to the modelâ€™s keypoint structure, support for exercise-specific configurations, geometric analysis of poses and generation of contextual feedback to guide users during workouts.
